# oop-inventory-sales-management-system

My OOP custom project: a bicycle shop inventory and sales management system.

NOTE:

After cloning, 3 empty _.txt_ files must be manually created in the _\\CustomProgram\bin\Debug\\_ directory. They are:

1. _products.txt_
2. _inventory_items.txt_
3. _transactions.txt_

These files are for data persistence. The program will not run without these files.
