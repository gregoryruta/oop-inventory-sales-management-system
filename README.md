# oop-inventory-sales-management-system

My OOP custom project: a bicycle shop inventory and sales management system.

NOTE:

After cloning, 3 empty .txt files must be manually created in the \CustomProgram\bin\Debug\ directory. They are:

1. products.txt
2. inventory_items.txt
3. transactions.txt

These files are for data persistence. The program will not run without these files.
